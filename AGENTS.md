# Repository instructions

## Documentation voice

- Write my decisions and responsibilities in first person: “I”, “me”, and “my”.
- Do not describe me in third person as “the maintainer” or “the owner”.
- Address instructions for contributors and template users directly to the reader.
- These rules also apply to issue and pull request text and comments written on my behalf: do not call me "the owner", "the user" or by name there; use direct, impersonal or first-person wording.

## Repository scope

- Describe this repository's current files, configuration, and behavior.
- Do not insert references to other repositories, copied-from history, unrelated projects, or conversation context into operational documentation.
- Make reusable guidance self-contained so it remains accurate in newly generated repositories.
- Keep necessary platform/dependency documentation links and third-party license notices. Put licensing attribution in dedicated license files, not operational guides.
- Do not invent project history, capabilities, or dependencies.

## Branch names

Use descriptive prefixes such as `docs/`, `fix/`, `feat/`, or `chore/`. Do not use `codex/` or `claude/`.

## Commit authorship

Author every commit as me, not under an assistant's identity. Before committing, set the repository's Git `user.name` and `user.email` to the name and GitHub noreply address (`<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`) that my own commits in this repository use. Do not add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer that credits an assistant. Never rewrite existing history to change authors.

## Audience separation

Keep editorial rules, assistant instructions, branch-naming preferences, and collaboration conventions in this file. Reader-facing documentation must explain the repository and its usage, not our writing process. Apply the requested voice naturally; do not explain that prose is written “in my voice”.

## Review findings

When a review of this repository finds something to fix, record each finding, or each group of findings that one change will fix, as an issue before or instead of fixing it silently. Every such issue must pass **Issue triage** (`docs/repo_governance/ISSUE_LABELS.md`):

- assigned to me;
- exactly one priority label (`P1` only for a confirmed calculation bug), plus the type labels that fit;
- the open milestone with the earliest due date;
- a `- Target end date: YYYY-MM-DD (Europe/Rome)` line earlier than that milestone's due date;
- a dependency section that names prerequisites or says "None".

Describe the finding with its file and line, the evidence, why it matters, and the proposed fix, so the issue can be resolved without the review that found it.

## Domain defaults

This repository holds, or provides the starting point for, a regulatory risk calculation workbook such as SA-CCR, SFT, FRTB, LCR, or NSFR. Excel workbooks, exported VBA source, regulatory source copies under `docs/methodology/sources/`, the P1 definition for confirmed calculation bugs, the `traffic-history` branch, and related reserved paths are intended defaults. Do not report them as leftovers from another project.

The repository is licensed under MPL-2.0 through the root `LICENSE` unless that file says otherwise. Keep `docs/licenses/` for the files listed in its third-party notice.

## Reusable defaults

Preserve useful policies and assumptions for file types, tooling, and reserved paths even when this repository does not use them yet. Adapt project-specific names and historical references without stripping reusable capabilities. Describe reserved paths as conventions, not as files or directories that already exist.
