# 📜 Changelog

Notable changes to this repository, from a user's point of view. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). It is
neither a commit log nor release evidence. **No version has been released.**

## 🧭 Maintenance policy

- Add a material change under `[Unreleased]` in the pull request that makes
  it. A change nobody would notice, such as a typo or a refactor with no
  effect, needs no entry.
- Describe the observable result: what exists, what a user or contributor
  can now do, what changed in a contract, and what to do about it.
- Link the issue or pull request that holds the detail.
- Record only evidence that was produced. A static check is not an Excel run:
  say what was and was not run in Excel.
- Once a version has been released, edit an existing entry of the next
  version rather than adding one that describes a change to its unreleased
  work: an entry describes what the release contains. The first release's
  section also records, as **Changed** and **Fixed**, how its additions
  changed while it was prepared.
- Entries move into a dated section only when a release is prepared, as
  [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) describes. After that, until the tag exists,
  a fix for a release gate that failed on the candidate records its change in
  the dated section being released
  ([step 2](RELEASING.md#2-integrate-and-freeze-the-candidate)). A published section is not
  rewritten; a demonstrable error is corrected in review, with a line
  `Corrected after release on YYYY-MM-DD: <reason>` in that section.

### Date and version rules

`python tools/check_changelog.py` checks the headings, dates, order, link
references and `VERSION`, and that this introduction, the *Current status* of
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md#current-status) and the README describe the same
release state; **Repository integrity** also checks that every link reference
points to this repository. Once a release's tag exists, its section must equal
that section at the tag, unless it holds the dated correction line above; a
correction is reported as a note. What a version number means is checked
in review.

| Rule | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Version | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, without a leading `v` in headings |
| Release heading | `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, with a real calendar date |
| Order | `[Unreleased]` first, then releases from newest to oldest, by version and date |
| Link references | One for `[Unreleased]` and one for every release; a release's points to `.../releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` |
| `0.y.z` | Initial development: no compatibility is promised between versions |
| Patch, minor, major | From `1.0.0`: a compatible correction, a compatible capability, an incompatible change to a calculation result, an input or output layout, or the supported VBA API |

| Category | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| **Added** | New capabilities, files, checks or tests |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing behaviour, contracts, tooling or documentation |
| **Fixed** | Corrected defects |
| **Security** | Safely disclosed security corrections |
| **Validation** | Evidence actually produced |
| **Known limitations** | Deliberate, unresolved boundaries |

Use only the categories an entry needs.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The README describes this repository: a workbook for the FRTB simplified
  standardised approach, its status, with no calculation and no release yet,
  and what is in place. It no longer holds the steps for setting up a new
  repository or the banner image (#3).
- The social preview image is this repository's own: the project name and
  scope, the four scaling factors of the simplified standardised approach
  and the build chain, with no result figure. The README shows it again,
  and `docs/assets/README.md` says how to render it from
  `docs/assets/social-preview.html` (#6).

### Fixed

- `INSTALLATION.md` no longer lists a tested environment for a commit that is
  not in this repository's history, and the *Host behaviour* table of the
  validation plan no longer cites issues that do not exist here. The three
  measured behaviours keep their probe, host, date and result (#5).
- The guides describe this repository instead of a template: the structure
  guide states what exists here, with `VERSION` not existing yet; the house
  style names the `FRTBSSA` prefix; the label and traffic guides and the
  Dependabot header no longer give steps for a newly created repository; and
  the setup guide says that its setup is done (#9).
- The pull request guide no longer says that Codex needs an environment to
  review: it reviews this repository's pull requests without one (#10).
